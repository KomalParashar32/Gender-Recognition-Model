# Gender-Recognition-Model
1. Dataset: The first code performs the function of segregation on the data set.
            It will be responsible for the formation of the aforementioned folders and then consequently dividing them into the male and female.

2. Model: The second code performs the function of prediction. 
          This will help in the main function that model needs to perform and that is to predict whether the person in the sample space is male or female.

3. Prediction: The third code performs the main function of Convolution Neural Network and takes on the information from the aforementioned codes and hence is responsible for the generation of sequential model.
